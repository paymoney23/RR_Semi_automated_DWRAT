#----PURPOSE:----
# This master script runs the processing and scraping scripts in order to generate the
# PRMS and SRP dat files. After both the PRMS and SRP models are run, the remaining scripts
# process the model outputs to generate a single supply dataset, Raw_Flows.csv, which
# serves as an input for DWRAT. 

# Include forecasted data from CNRFC in the datasets? ----
# (This should be either "TRUE" or "FALSE")
includeForecast <- FALSE

# Include flagging and remediation blocks in Dat_PRMS.R? 
#  Set to TRUE or FALSE after consulting with SDU management for that month's runs. TRUE means
# that the flagging and remediation code blocks in the Dat_PRMS.R script will be executed. FALSE
# means that those blocks will be skipped;

# set start and end dates -------------------------------------------------
## Set start dates----

Hydro_StartDate = as.Date("2024-10-01", format = "%Y-%m-%d") #, start of the current water year,
# serves as the start date of the hydro simulation, 

  #usually the 1st day of the following month

#Serves as the start date for the observed data forecast and the DAT_Shell

# Extract Day, Month, and Year from StartDate; functions require lubridate package
StartDay <- day(StartDate) 
StartMonth <- month(StartDate)
StartYear <- year(StartDate)
StartDate <- data.frame(date = StartDate, day = StartDay, month = StartMonth, year = StartYear)

## set end date----
EndDate <- as.Date("2025-04-30")# set to desired end date for observed meteorological data range
EndDay <- day(EndDate) 
EndMonth <- month(EndDate)
EndYear <- year(EndDate)

Hydro_EndDate = as.Date("2025-09-30", format = "%Y-%m-%d") #serves as the end date for the hydrological flows;
  # usually the last day of the next month

#Define the modeler_name variable-this is the first initial and last name of the modeler
