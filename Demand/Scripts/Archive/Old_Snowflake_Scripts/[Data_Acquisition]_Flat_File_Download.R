# Downloading Flat Files Required by QAQC Process----

# Two flat files are required:
# Water Use Report Extended
# eWRIMS Flat File POD



# Some data filtering was already applied in Snowflake:


# water_use_report_extended

# A subset of columns was selected:
# AMOUNT, APPLICATION_ACCEPTANCE_DATE, APPL_ID, APPLICATION_PRIMARY_OWNER,
# APPLICATION_RECD_DATE, MONTH, YEAR, DIRECT_DIV_SEASON_END, DIRECT_DIV_SEASON_START,
# DIVERSION_TYPE, EFFECTIVE_DATE, EFFECTIVE_FROM_DATE, FACE_VALUE_AMOUNT,
# FACE_VALUE_UNITS, INI_REPORTED_DIV_AMOUNT, INI_REPORTED_DIV_UNIT, MAX_STORAGE,
# PARTY_ID, PRIMARY_OWNER_ENTITY_TYPE, PRIORITY_DATE, SOURCE_NAME, STORAGE_SEASON_END,
# STORAGE_SEASON_START, SUB_TYPE, TRIB_DESC, USE_CODE, WATER_RIGHT_STATUS,
# WATER_RIGHT_TYPE, WATERSHED

# The data was filtered to YEAR >= 2016


# eWRIMS Flat File POD

# A subset of columns was selected:

# "HUC_12_NUMBER", "HUC_8_NAME", "HUC_8_NUMBER", "LATITUDE", "LICENSE_ID",
