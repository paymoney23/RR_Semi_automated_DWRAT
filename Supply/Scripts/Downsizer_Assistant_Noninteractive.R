#----PURPOSE:----

# OBSOLETE because SDA has replaced Downsizer with NOAA API downloads

# The Downsizer application is one of the first steps in running the PRMS Model
# However, it cannot be perfectly automated

# This script aids the user in running that application
# It also prepares the file output for the next step

# Note: This script will only work on devices that use Windows
