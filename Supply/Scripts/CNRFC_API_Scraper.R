# This script completes the same objective as "Scripts/CNRFC_Selenium_Scraper.R" 
# However, it does not rely on RSelenium

# As of 6/6/2024, this script can be skipped because SDA no longer uses CNRFC
# forecast data. This script downloads the 6-day forecasted
# temperature and precipitation data via API for the 13 CNRFC stations that 
# correspond to our observed weather stations. Most CNRFC stations correspond to
# more than one observed weather station--that's why we have fewer CNRFC
# stations than observed weather stations.
